# Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Design Space Exploration for Digital Multipliers
This repository contains the complete codebase, configuration files, and result visualizations for the research project exploring how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can improve Design Space Exploration (DSE) in the context of digital multiplier architectures.
## Project Overview
Digital multipliers are fundamental components in many hardware systems, and optimizing their design involves navigating a vast space of architectural choices. This project leverages RL agents to intelligently explore that space, aiming to discover high-performance, low-resource designs more efficiently than traditional methods.
